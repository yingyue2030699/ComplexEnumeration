def get_cubed_sphere_grid_points(delta):
    """
    Generate a set of quasi-uniform grid points on the surface of a unit sphere
    using a cubed-sphere projection approach.

    This creates points by placing a grid on each face of a cube,
    projecting those points onto the unit sphere, and symmetrizing via permutations.

    Parameters
    ----------
    delta : float
        Approximate angular resolution (in radians). Smaller delta â†’ more points.

    Returns
    -------
    generator of np.ndarray
        Yields 3D unit vectors uniformly spread on the sphere.

    Examples
    --------
    >>> points = list(get_cubed_sphere_grid_points(0.5))
    >>> len(points)
    216
    >>> np.allclose(np.linalg.norm(points[0]), 1.0)
    True
